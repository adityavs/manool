MANOOL v0.3.0 (work in progress)
================================

MANOOL is a programming language with the same purpose as Python, Ruby, PHP, Common Lisp, or Scheme, but it is designed with one central idea in mind:
  * to maximize the *expressive power / implementation complexity* ratio.

The author's implementation fits in only 10 KLOC in C++, yet it exhibits competitive run-time performance.

**For a complete project overview**, please refer to [Introduction to MANOOL](https://manool.org/specification/introduction-to-manool).

"**MA**NOOL is *Not* an Object-Oriented Language!"
