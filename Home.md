*My name is Alex Protasov (AKA [rusini](about "About @rusini")) and I have designed and implemented a brand-new programming language called MANOOL.*

<figure><img src="Manul-Cat.jpeg" width="204" height="272" alt="Pallas's cat" title="Pallas's cat"></figure>

The name "MANOOL" is a [recursive acronym] that stands for "**MA**NOOL is _Not_ an [Object-Oriented Language]!"; it is just a [pun] on the renowned marketing
hype of the past. "MANOOL" should be pronounced as "manul" ([the Pallas's cat]).

[recursive acronym]:        //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_acronym        "Wikipedia: Recursive acronym"
[Object-Oriented Language]: //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_language "Wikipedia: Object-oriented language"
[pun]:                      //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pun                      "Wikipedia: Pun"
[the Pallas's cat]:         //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pallas%27s_cat           "Wikipedia: Pallas's cat"

MANOOL is a programming language with the same purpose as Python, Ruby, PHP, Common Lisp, or Scheme, but it is designed with one central idea in mind:
  * to maximize the _expressive power_ / _implementation complexity_ ratio.

The author's implementation fits in only 10 KLOC in C++, yet it exhibits competitive run-time performance.

**For a complete project overview**, please refer to [Introduction to MANOOL](specification/introduction-to-manool).

**MANOOL is a personal project** with no external funding or endorsement whatsoever, but it includes a solid, open implementation.

If you ever happen to have a general data processing problem with _no_ dependency on existing code and/or third-party libraries, please [give MANOOL a
try](download "How to Download and Install MANOOL") --- **you might benefit from a more recent and careful programming language design!**
